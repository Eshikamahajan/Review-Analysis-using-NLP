##About Analysis_using_NLP.py

Sentiment analysis is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that consists in extracting emotions related to some raw texts. This is usually used on social media posts and customer reviews in order to automatically understand if some users' reviews are positive or negative.

The tsv file contains the feedback of the restaurant customers (1000 in number). The positive review is labelled as '1' and the negative review is labelled '0'.

3 models are used for for classifying the reviews in the tsv file, namely Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Decision tree.
Their output is compared using evaluation paramaters like Accuracy,Precision,recall and F1_score.

Decision Tree is found to have the most accurate classification of positive and negative reviews followed by Random Forest.
